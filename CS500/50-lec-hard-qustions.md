B) Cylinder
C) Sector
D) Platter

✅ **Answer:** C

---

**Q9.** A cylinder consists of:
A) All sectors on one track
B) One track on one platter
C) Tracks at the same radius on all platters
D) All sectors on one platter

✅ **Answer:** C

---

## 4. Capacity Calculation (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Q10.** Hard disk capacity depends on all **EXCEPT**:
A) Number of platters
B) Number of tracks per surface
C) Number of sectors per track
D) Seek time

✅ **Answer:** D

---

**Q11.** If a disk has 2 platters, 2 surfaces per platter, 128 tracks per surface,
8 sectors per track, and 512 bytes per sector, the total capacity is:

A) 1 MB
B) 2 MB
C) 4 MB
D) 8 MB

✅ **Answer:** C
*(Calculation: 2×2×128×8×512 = 4,194,304 bytes)*

---

## 5. Performance Metrics (HIGH FREQUENCY)

**Q12.** Seek time refers to:
A) Time to rotate the disk
B) Time to move the head to the desired track
C) Time to transfer data
D) Time to execute an instruction

✅ **Answer:** B

---

**Q13.** Rotational latency is defined as:
A) Full rotation time of the disk
B) Half the rotation time of the disk
C) Seek time + transfer time
D) Transfer rate of the disk

✅ **Answer:** B

---

**Q14.** Disk access time is equal to:
A) Seek time + transfer rate
B) Rotation delay + transfer rate
C) Seek time + rotation delay
D) Seek time × rotation delay

✅ **Answer:** C

---

## 6. RPM & Transfer Rate

**Q15.** If a disk rotates at 600 RPM, how many rotations per second does it make?
A) 5
B) 10
C) 20
D) 60

✅ **Answer:** B
*(600 ÷ 60 = 10 rps)*

---
